This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
The model is trained on grayscale images of digits (0â€“9) and achieves high accuracy by learning spatial hierarchies of features through convolutional layers. 
The project demonstrates image preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation using TensorFlow.
